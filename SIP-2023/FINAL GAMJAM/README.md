# GWC SIP 2023 Final Culmination Project/Gamejam
This was the game that culminated my experience in this program. I based it on the avoider style game we previously made. For this GameJam, we had roughly a week to build it. 




### Project Requirements
Your project should:
- Include at least five screens with text related to your story on each.
- Start on a home screen that begins the story.
- Include at least two screens that offer players a choice between two options.
- Use p5play properties to style your button sprites.
- Apply nested conditionals, variables, and the `mouse.presses` method to code branching paths in your story.
- Create and call a function for each screen to keep your code organized.
- Optional:
  - Create a flowchart and storyboard to prototype your CYOA mod.
  - Mod the base game to make it your own by updating the game text and visuals to display your own story.
