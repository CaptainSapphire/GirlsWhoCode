### Project Requirements
pProject should:
- Use a variable to store and print the data of your favorite movie.

- Calculate the min, max, mean, and median of a column.
- Print how the min, max mean, and median compare to your favorite movie's value.
- Create a histogram and use a print statement to describe it.
- Create a scatter plot and use a print statement to describe the relationship between two variables.
