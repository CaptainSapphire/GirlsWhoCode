# Empowering Data Project 
This was the final project for the GWC SPP 2023 Data Science For Good Certification. I struggled with finding a good graph and data points I could use for my story, but I really enjoyed this nonetheless.
Overall, I am incredibly proud of all I learned in this course and this very project. 

### Project Requirements
Project should:
- Include a Setting for the story
- Include the Context of the story
- Include Characters 
- Include a visual graph
- Include a research question which can help solve the problem the people in your story face
